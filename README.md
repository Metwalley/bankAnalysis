# **Bank Customers Data Analysis & Cleaning Project**  

📊 **Comprehensive Data Cleaning & Analysis for Bank Customer Insights**  

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a **financial dataset** containing customer information, transaction details, and loan performance records. The goal is to **enhance data quality**, extract meaningful insights, and provide actionable recommendations for financial decision-making.  

## 📌 **Key Objectives**  
✅ Identify and resolve missing values, duplicates, and erroneous data  
✅ Standardize inconsistent formats and outlier handling  
✅ Perform **data transformation** and feature engineering for better analysis  
✅ Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) for customer segmentation, loan performance, and transaction patterns  
✅ Develop interactive **visualizations & dashboards** for better insights  

## 🛠 **Tools & Technologies Used**  
- **Programming & Data Analysis:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Database & Querying:** SQL  
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Power Query, Pandas  
- **Version Control & Documentation:** Git, Jupyter Notebook  

## 🔍 **Data Cleaning Process**  
The data cleaning phase involved:  
1. **Handling Missing Values** – Imputation & removal of incomplete records  
2. **Removing Duplicates** – Identified and eliminated duplicate rows  
3. **Correcting Data Types** – Standardized formats for consistency  
4. **Handling Outliers** – Detected and addressed extreme values  
5. **Standardizing Formats** – Unified date, categorical, and numerical representations  
6. **Feature Engineering** – Created calculated columns for deeper analysis  

## 📈 **Key Findings & Insights**  
- **Loan Performance:** Default rates are higher in low-income regions  
- **Customer Segmentation:** Younger customers tend to have lower account balances  
- **Transaction Analysis:** Digital transactions peak between **12 PM - 3 PM**  
- **Geographical Trends:** Urban customers hold higher balances, while rural areas see higher default rates  

## 📊 **Dashboard & Visualizations**  
We built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize trends, correlations, and customer behaviors effectively.  

## 🎯 **Recommendations**  
📌 Improve **data collection standards** to reduce inconsistencies  
📌 Implement **targeted marketing** for high-value customer segments  
📌 Strengthen **credit risk assessments** in regions with high default rates  
📌 Leverage **machine learning models** for predictive analytics
